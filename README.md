Welcome to this repository! We are the SeismoMiracles team, and we have been working on the Seismic Detection Across the Solar System challenge.
You can run this project via app.py (requires tensorflow, obspy, customtkinter, tkinter, scipy, sklearn)


You can also view examples of our program output in the example_plots folder.


Important information on graphs! Left - filtered and analized, right - raw.

Red vertical line - the beginning of the earthquake.

Green solid line - the line of background activity.

Green dashed line - earthquake registration zone.

Pink vertical line - activity according to the spectrogram.

Pink diagonal line - the interval from the peak of activity to its fall serves to search for the essence of the earthquake.
