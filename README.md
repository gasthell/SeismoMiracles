Welcome to this repository! We are the SeismoMiracles team, and we have been working on the Seismic Detection Across the Solar System challenge.
You can run this project via app.py (requires tensorflow, obspy, customtkinter, tkinter, scipy, sklearn)

But we also have a public exe file! (When unpacking, make sure that _internal and app.exe are in the same folder!):


You can also view examples of our program output in the example_plots folder

Important information on graphs!
Red vertical line - the beginning of the earthquake
Green solid line - the line of background activity
Green dashed line - earthquake registration zone
Pink vertical line - activity according to the spectrogram
Pink diagonal line - the interval from the peak of activity to its fall serves to search for the essence of the earthquake
